## ECG
An electrocardiogram (ECG) is a simple test that can be used to check your heart's rhythm and electrical activity.
Sensors attached to the skin are used to detect the electrical signals produced by your heart each time it beats.
These signals are recorded by a machine and are looked at by a doctor to see if they're unusual.
An ECG is often used alongside other tests to help diagnose and monitor conditions affecting the heart.

## BPM
Your pulse rate, also known as your heart rate, is the number of times your heart beats per minute. 
A normal resting heart rate should be between 60 to 100 beats per minute, but it can vary from minute to minute
